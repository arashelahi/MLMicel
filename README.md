The MLMicel package enables the detection of separate micelles, using an unsupervised machine learning-based algorithm. This model is particularly developed for the detection of separate polymeric micelles, but can be utilized for other molecular aggregates.
The funtionalities of the MLMicel are:
1. Identification of the separate micelles.
2.
